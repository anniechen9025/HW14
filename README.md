# 14.Model-View-Controller (MVC): Tech Blog

## Description
We had been learning how to use node and sequalize to connect database and server and also using handlebars to switch route and pages. I learn how to structure connection between database and grab the information from database to show properly on the handlebar template which also using route to update the database. It was challenge to get the information associated with each other front and back and using route for specific detail into back-end server. Over all I enjoy the process of seeing database being edit, add and delet by GET, POST and PUT methods.
